This project features a lexical analyzer (lexer), syntax analyzer (parser), and semantic analyzer coded in the Java programming language. The GUI wss made by utilizing [JavaFX][3] and [SceneBuilder][4].

Loco aims to able to correctly execute `.lol` files. Most of Lolcode syntax has already been implemented.
