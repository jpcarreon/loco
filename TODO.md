# TODO List

### Page 4

* All variables must be declared outside any program blocks (if-else, loops, etc), but are not required to be at the start of the program.
* Initialization may contain any operation that results to a literal value. (`infarop` included)

### Page 5
* ~~`ALL OF` and `ANY OF` are not binary~~

### Misc
* ~~Disallow explicit access to `IT`~~
* ~~_Fix_ infinite arity operations (`VISIBLE`, `SMOOSH`, `infarop`)~~
* ~~Evaluate `infarop`~~

### Bonus
* Soft line breaks (`,`)
* Line continuation (`...`)
* ~~Special Characters in YARN (`:>`, `:)`, etc)~~
* ~~Special characters in strings~~
* ~~Loop-nesting~~
* ~~If-then nesting~~
* ~~Else-if clauses~~
* Functions
* ~~Suppress `\n` in `VISIBLE` by ending a statement with `!`~~
